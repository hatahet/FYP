How many buyers and sellers a simulation should have?
Should we seperate attack models and defense models?
How should we collect the input data?
	There should be a module to collect input data from real website
	A module to correlate the data so that generated data look relevant 
	A module to generate attack data 
		Base on an attack model



The simulation will be composed of a defined number of sellers and buyers. Each seller will have a number of items to sell, and buyers should have some random distribution of number of items to buy. 

The model will be run synchronously
Set up:
?	Each seller will have a number of items to sell
?	Each seller has a track record or history of trading, a trust level
?	Each buyers has a track record or history of trading, a trust level
At each time step: 
?	A buyer could place a rating to an unlimited number of buyers
?	A buyer could only have 1 vote for each author at any one time

Questions: 
?	Is this a market place (like ebay, where you need to purchase an item before commenting the seller) or is it a common site where everyone could register and leave feedback (something like imdb.com)
?	Should we focus on the voting part, or the simulation of a market place – including buying, selling, bidding and commenting?
?	How could we realistically learn the data and inject them into our model?
?	What is the number of buyers and sellers in the system? Could we have only one seller and many buyers? In the simplest case, could we have 1 buyer and 1 sellers – may be it depends on the type of the attack
